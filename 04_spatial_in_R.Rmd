## Vector data in R
<br>
### Introduction to sp and sf packages
The `sp` package (spatial) provides classes and methods for spatial (vector) data; the classes document where the spatial location information resides, for 2D or 3D data. Utility functions are provided, e.g. for plotting data as maps, spatial selection, as well as methods for retrieving coordinates, for subsetting, print, summary, etc.

The `sf` package (simple features = points, lines, polygons and their respective 'multi' versions) is the new kid on the block with further functions to work with simple features, a standardized way to encode spatial vector data. It binds to the packages 'GDAL' for reading and writing data, to 'GEOS' for geometrical operations, and to 'PROJ' for projection conversions and datum transformations.

For the time being, it is best to know and use both the sp and the sf packages, as discussed in [this post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/should-i-learn-sf-or-sp-for-spatial-r-programming/). However, we focus on the `sf` package. for the following reasons:

-   sf ensures fast reading and writing of data
-   sf provides enhanced plotting performance
-   sf objects can be treated as data frames in most operations
-   sf functions can be combined using %\>% operator and works well with the tidyverse collection of R packages.
-   sf function names are relatively consistent and intuitive (all begin with st\_) However, in some cases we need to transform sf objects to sp objects or vice versa. In that case, a simple transformation to the desired class is necessary:

To sp `object <- as(object, Class = "Spatial")`

To sf `object_sf = st_as_sf(object_sp, "sf")`

A word of advice: be flexible in the usage of sf and sp. Sometimes it may be hard to explain why functions work for one data type and do not for the other. But since transformation is quite easy, time is better spend on analyzing your data than on wondering why operations do not work. For the purpose of this material we will focus of teaching you the package `sf` as it is intended to succeed and replace R packages `sp`, `rgeos` and the vector parts of `rgdal` packages. It also connects nicely to tidyverse learnt in previous modules.


<br>

### Importing spatial data into R (Spatial points and polygons)

To import data we would first need to start with loading the library

```{r libraries, warning = F}
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(tidyverse)
```

<br>

#### Shapefiles
Shapefiles can be called in to R using the function `st_read()`. Similarly to `read_csv()` we include a filepath to a shapefile. In this instance we would load the part of the shapefile that ends with *.shp*

```{r read_dat}
fakeland <- st_read("shapefiles/FAK_HDs.shp")
```

You'll notice that when you load the shapefile in, there will be a set of information explaining the features of the shapefile. The first sentence shows that you have loaded a ESRI shapefile, it contains 46 features (which are polygons in this case) and 5 columns of information stored as a data tabel. It mentions also there is a spatial extent (called bounding box) and the coordinate reference system (CRS).

you can also get this information when you simply call the sf object

```{r sf1, results ='hide',message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
fakeland
```

```{r figurename3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/features.png")
```

In this case it is important to read in and check the metadata for the type of spatial information you have loaded.

<br>

#### Spatial points
Another key type of spatial data is data linked to coordinates, frequently found in a table format. We can read these data in using the `read_csv()` function, then we may want to convert these into spatial information using the `st_as_sf()` function. Here we have a csv file containing the coordinates for the locations of health facilities in our routine data. Note that we set the projection for the spatial object using the `crs` command; crs 4326 is the standard WGS 84 CRS.  

```{r make points}
fakeland_hf_gps <- read_csv("data/fakeland_hf_gps.csv")

# Make the gps data into a point simple feature
fakeland_hf_points <- st_as_sf(fakeland_hf_gps, coords = c("X", "Y"), crs = 4326)
```

<br>

#### Shapefile projections 
We learnt about the importance of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) for projecting spatial data in module 3. Using the sf package it is easy to view your data on different projects and switch between different projections.

We have already seen that you can identify the CRS when reading in a shapefile using `st_read` and when viewing the features of a shapefile. You can also see the CRS using the command `st_crs()`

```{r}
st_crs(fakeland)
```
We can then change the projection using the command `st_transform()`. We can also combine the two commands to change the projection of one data type to be that of the other. 

```{r, out.width='50%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='default'}
# Change the projection to UTM zone 17N
fakeland_utm <- st_transform(fakeland, 26717)

ggplot(fakeland_utm)+
  geom_sf()+
  theme_bw()

# Change the projection of the fakeland_utm shapefile to match that of the original fakeland
fakeland2 <- st_transform(fakeland_utm, st_crs(fakeland))

ggplot(fakeland2)+
  geom_sf()+
  theme_bw()

```

<br>

### Joining data to shapefiles
We often want to join data to shapefiles to enable the creation of maps and to analyse spatial data. You can use the join functions shown in module 2 to join sf data to tables. Just note that the sf data must go first to automatically be recognised as sf. Else you would need to reset it using `st_as_sf()`

```{r load data}
annual_data <- read_csv("data/annual_admin_data.csv")

annual_data_sf <- fakeland  %>%  
                  left_join(annual_data, by = c("adm2", "adm1")) 

```

<br>

### Writing shapefiles out in R
`st_write` can be used in the same way as `write_csv` to save shapefiles. 

```{r write out, eval=FALSE}
st_write(annual_data_sf, "outputs/annual_admin_routine_data.shp")
```

<br>

> ### Task 1
> - Load in the data for fakeland admin units
> - What type of spatial data is this shapefile?
> - What projection is this shapefile in?

<br>

## Raster data
Raster data has historically been dealt with in R primarily using the `raster` package, however, this is being discontinued as replaced by the `terra` package. We can start by loading the package in R.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(terra)
```

In terra we deal with rasters as a class of data called "SpatRaster". This is a multi-layered feature which stores the parameters to describe the raster, including then number or rows and columns, the spatial extent and projection. 

<br>

### Loading raster data
We can import raster data using the function `rast()`, and look at the raster properties by calling the object.

```{r}
population <- rast("rasters/ihme_corrected_worldpop_All_Ages_3_2018.tif")
population
```

We can view the raster simply by using the `plot()` function. 
 
```{r, out.width = '60%'}
plot(population)
```

We can also use this function to read in a stack of multiple rasters. In the raster folder you will find a series of rasters with the prefix "GPMM", these are the monthly rainfall at a 5km resolution for Fakeland. We can identify these rasters using the regular expression and read them in as a raster stack using `rast()`.

```{r, out.width = '60%'}
file.names <- list.files(path = 'rasters/', pattern = '^GPMM.*?\\.tif$', full.names = T)

GPMM <- rast(file.names)

plot(GPMM)
```
Lets rename the rasters in the stack to make the names more meaningful. We can also use the index number to extract a single layer. We can select one raster in the stack by using the numerical index. So this would give us the monthly rainfall raster for June.

```{r, out.width = '60%'}
names(GPMM) <-  c('GPMM_Jan', 'GPMM_Feb', 'GPMM_Mar', 'GPMM_Apr', 'GPMM_May', 'GPMM_Jun', 
                  'GPMM_Jul', 'GPMM_Aug', 'GPMM_Sep', 'GPMM_Oct', 'GPMM_Nov', 'GPMM_Dec')

plot(GPMM[[6]])
```

<br>

### Plotting, reprojecting and manipulating Rasters in R
<br>
#### Plotting rasters
We can quickly summarise the data from rasters in plots such as histograms.

```{r, out.width = '60%'}
hist(log(population)) #plotting the log of the population due to the scale
```

Additionally we can also use `ggplot` to visualise rasters, giving us more control over the appearance of the plot. First you need to convert the raster to a data frame, then it can be plotted using `geom_raster`. We can then use the same functions to control the appearance of the plot discussed in the data visualisation module.

```{r, out.width = '60%'}
pop_df <- as.data.frame(population, xy = TRUE)

ggplot()+
  geom_raster(data = pop_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = ihme_corrected_worldpop_All_Ages_3_2018 ))+
  scale_fill_viridis_c()+
  labs(fill = "Population")+
  theme_bw()

```

<br>

#### Reprojecting rasters
As with the shapefiles it is important to know and control the projection of the raster. We can find out what the current projection is and change it using the `crs()` function. This will allow us to work with rasters and other spatial data.

```{r}
crs(population)

crs(population) <- "+proj=utm +zone=48 +datum=WGS84"
```

<br>

#### Manipulating rasters
We can find out the spatial extent of a raster by using the `ext()` function, and easily crop the raster to other extents using `crop()`. We can specify the coordinates we wish to crop the raster to, or a take the extent from a spatial object and crop the raster to that. 

```{r, out.width = '60%'}
ext(population)
pop1 <- crop(population, c(-1,2,9,10))   # c(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
plot(pop1)

# Get the extend of the "West" region of fakeland
e <- filter(fakeland, adm1 == 'West') %>% 
  ext()

# Crop the raster to the same extent
West_pop <- crop(population, e)
ext(West_pop)
```

We may then want to change all of the raster cells which lay outside of the polygon for the West region to be NA. This can be done using `mask()`.

```{r}
library(terra)
m <- filter(fakeland, adm1 == 'West')

West_pop <-  mask(West_pop, vect(m))

plot(West_pop)
```

<br>

### Extracting raster data
We frequently want to extract values from rasters. This could be extracting all values within a polygon of a shapefile to perform calculations on (such as summing the population in each district), or extracting values for specific coordinates. This can be done using the `extract()` function. This can extract data from locations stored as a spatial vector (SpatVector - points, polygons or lines), a matrix with coordinates (x,y) or a vector of cell numbers. 

Firstly, if we wanted to extract the population values for the first 5 cells in the raster we could use this command:

```{r}
terra::extract(population, c(1,2,3,4,5))
```

Next, if we had a specific set of coordinates we wanted to know the population at, we would define these coordinates in a matrix with the longitude (x) as the first value, and the latitude (y) as the second value (N.B They must be in this order) then use the `extract()` function. 

```{r}
coords <- cbind(1, 8)

extract(population, coords) # Extract the population for these coordinates
```

If we had a vector of spatial vector of coordinates, such as our dataset of health facility locations, we can pass this to the `extract()` function to get the raster values for each point. This function additionally works on raster stacks. If we run this on our stack of monthly rainfall rasters we can see that the values are extracted for each set of coordinates from each monthly raster. These can then be processed as a normal data frame


```{r}
GPMM_extract <- extract(GPMM, vect(fakeland_hf_points))

head(GPMM_extract)
```

Finally, we look at extracting the population values for each admin 2 district of fakeland. For this we provide `extract()` with the raster and the shapefile. The output is then the population value for each cell of the raster, linked to each polygon ID of the shapefile. We can the perform summary statistic on this as we would a standard data frame.

```{r}
fakeland_pop <- extract(population, vect(fakeland))

head(fakeland)

fakeland_pop <- fakeland_pop %>% 
  group_by(ID) %>% 
  summarise(population = sum(ihme_corrected_worldpop_All_Ages_3_2018, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  mutate(adm2 = fakeland$adm2)
```

<br>

### Writing rasters out in R
We can save a rasters in a variety of formats using `writeRaster`. Here was dave it as a ".tif"

```{r, eval=F}
writeRaster(West_pop, "rasters/West_adm1_population.tif")
```


<br>

> ### Task 2
> - Import the fakeland shapefile, ensure the projection is > in "4326" (WGS84)
> - Import the raster  "ihme_corrected_worldpop_All_Ages_3_2018"
> - Find the mean population of the cells in each admin 2  district of fakeland
 
 <br>
 
## Demo 1
In this demo we will join together what we have learnt, importing the shapefile and population raster for Fakeland, calculating the total population. We will join our annually aggregated routine data with the population and calculated the annual parasite incidence then join this on to the shapefile,

```{r, message = F, results='hide'}
rm(list = ls())  # clear the console

# Import the data sources
annual_data <- read_csv('data/annual_admin_data.csv')
fakeland <- st_read('shapefiles/FAK_HDs.shp')
population <- rast('rasters/ihme_corrected_worldpop_All_Ages_3_2018.tif')

# Extract the population for each district
fakeland_pop <- 
  extract(population, vect(fakeland)) %>% 
  group_by(ID) %>% 
  summarise(population = sum(ihme_corrected_worldpop_All_Ages_3_2018, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  mutate(adm2 = fakeland$adm2) 

# Join onto the routine data and calculate incidence
annual_data <- 
  left_join(annual_data, fakeland_pop) %>% 
  mutate(API = conf/population*100000) %>% 
  select(adm1, adm2, API)

#Join the routine data onto the shapefile
fakeland_annual <- 
  left_join(fakeland, annual_data) 
```

<br>

## Making chloropleth maps in R

In the demo we have created a dataset with annual incidence at admin 2 level. The next obvious thing to do is have a look at it. In this section we'll explore some popular ways of making chloropleth maps in R. Although not designed as a full-scale GIS application, R (especially when combined with its vast ecosystem of packages) provides a powerful, endlessly customisable, tool for spatial visualisation.

<!-- With the demo we have created a dataset with annual incidence at admin 2 level  to be used for plotting. I you plan to do monthly maps or ones with different indicators then we can just change this demo section to show them making the data we need -->

<!-- Also we did have this section on plotting shapefiles in R put in early but i thought that may be duplicating what you will be doing. If you do want this intriduced earlier the we can put this back in after joining shapefiles otherwise use/delete this as needed -->

<br>

### Plotting spatial data using base R

It's possible to produce maps using nothing more than `rgdal`. Simply calling `plot` does the job, but plots out all attributes of our shapefile in quite an unappealing way. You can select out one attribute to plot using the normal R way of subsetting: `sf_object[name_of_attribute]`. This way we can very quickly plot out the API in Fakeland, as joined to the shapefile above, by admin2 unit:

```{r, message = F}

library(rgdal)


plot(fakeland_annual["API"])

```

By default R will place the legend wherever it thinks 'best', but you can specify location with the additional argument `key.pos` (1 for below; 2 left; 3 above and 4 to the right). `key.width` and `key.length` allow you to control the dimensions of the legend. 

```{r, message = F}

plot(fakeland_annual["API"], key.pos = 1)

```

Notice that by default the colour ramp is discrete. You can tune the colour breaks using either or both of `breaks` and `nbreaks`. `nbreaks` defines the number of breaks, `breaks` is either

* a vector of numbers defining the precise location of the breaks
* a string specifying the method to use to define the breaks -- by default R uses `pretty`, but other options include `equal`, `jenks` and `quantile`.

Titles can be specified using `main`, axes (with lat-longs) toggled on/off using `axes`. We can use a log-10 scale using `logz` (if using this careful with your breaks!). `pal` is a palette function, detemining the colour ramp. The default colour ramp is a bit 1980s for our purposes -- let's try Viridis instead.

```{r, message = F}

# define the palette
test_pal <- viridis::viridis(10)

plot(fakeland_annual["API"], 
     key.pos = 1,
     pal = test_pal,
     breaks = 'quantile',
     main = "API, Fakeland 20XX",
     axes = F,
     logz = T)

```

<br>

### Plotting shapefiles using `ggplot2``

The above is a perfectly servicable map. In practice, however, the flexibility of `ggplot2` is worth the install and the learning curve. You met `ggplot2` earlier today -- recall that the package implements 'the grammar of graphics' to build plots in layers.  This philosophy is powerful, allowing us a much greater degree of freedom in our map-making than we could achieve in base R.

<br>

### Adding features to maps

Recall from earlier the typical `ggplot` call: `ggplot(data, aesthetic)`. When making chloropleth maps, our data will typically be an `sf` object, with a column corresponding to the variable you wish to map, and a geometry column describing the geography of the data.

Given an `sf` object, you can use `geom_sf` to produce a simple plot of your shapefile without even explicitly defining any aesthetics.

```{r, message = F}
ggplot(fakeland) + 
  geom_sf() + # as we've called ggplot using an sf object as the data argument, geom_sf can figure it out itself
  coord_sf()  # deals with map projection 
```


`geom_sf` is a bit different to the `ggplot2` geometries you met earlier: it requires a new aesthetic, `geometry`. The good news is you often don't need to worry about specifying this, as `ggplot` tries to help behind the scenes:

 * If you supply no `geometry` argument to your `geom_sf` call, R will try to find a column in your provided data called 'geometry', and use that if it's suitable;
 * If you used an `sf` object in the function call (i.e. `geom_sf(data = sf_object,..)`) then ggplot can automatically detecte the geometry column (it doesn't even need to be called geometry!)
 * You can specify it manually, `aes(geometry = geometry_column)`. If you have multiple geometry columns you'll need to do this, as R can't read your mind.

Let's see how we can use `ggplot2` to map the API in each admin2 unit of Fakeland. To show the full range of variation on the map, we'll log-transform the colour-scale. Let's decide on some breaks:

```{r, message = F}

my_breaks <- c(signif(min(fakeland_annual$API)-1, 2), 8000, 160000, signif(max(fakeland_annual$API)+1, 2))
```


```{r, message = F}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = fakeland_annual, aes(fill = API), colour = "grey25") + # now we need to tell ggplot an antribute of the data to use as an aesthetic
  scale_fill_viridis_c(trans = "log", breaks = my_breaks) +
  labs(title = "API, Fakeland 20XX", fill = "") +
  coord_sf() + # deals with map projection
  guides() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "bottom", legend.key.width = unit(2,"cm"), legend.text=element_text(size=12)) 
```

Compare this to the base R map we made -- our colour scale is now continuous, but otherwise the plots are almost identical.

Breaking down the code we used to produce it:

`ggplot() + geom_sf(data = fakeland_annual, aes(fill = API), colour = "grey25") +`

After calling `ggplot()`, our first layer is a call to `geom_sf` pointing to our `sf` object. We're making a univariate map, so our aesthetics consists only of a single call to fill the polygons with the entries in `fakeland_annual$API` -- no need for a `geometry` call, here. `colour` determines the colour of the polygon outlines -- we're not varying that based on data, so it sits outside `aes`.

`scale_fill_viridis_c() +`

This next layer tells R to using a continuous viridis palette when filling our polygons. When filling with discrete (factor) data, you instead use `scale_fill_viridis_d()` here. The Viridis family of colourramps are designed to . Arguments you can pass to this function include `alpha`, to change transparency; `begin` and `end` to truncate the palette; `direction` to reverse it; and `option` to pick another palette in the viridis family. Four options are available: "magma" (or "A"), "inferno" (or "B"), "plasma" (or "C"), "viridis" (or "D", the default option used here) and "cividis" (or "E"). By default `NA`s will be shown in grey -- change this by setting `na.value` to the colour of your choice.

`labs(title = "API, Fakeland 20XX", fill = "") +`

It's rare that our short variable names are explanatory enough to show on a plot. `labs` allows us to define exactly what we want displayed, and define the plot title, subtitle, and even a caption (e.g. for attribution). Labels of aesthetics are set by referring back to that aesthetic: `fill`, `colour`, `alpha`, etc..

`coord_sf() + # deals with map projection`

The projection and extent of our map are controlled by this function. In this case, it's not doing anything -- we could happily have omitted it from our `ggplot` call. This is because by default `ggplot2` will use the CRS of the first layer which defines one -- here `fakeland_annual`. This can be overridden using a `crs` argument, which accepts any valid PROJ4 string.

`coord_sf` is also used to change the extent of our map -- by default the whole shapefile is shown, but providing `xlim` and `ylim` arguements can zoom in on areas of interest.

`guides() +`

This slightly counter-intuitively named function sets the legend type for each aesthetic -- colourbar, legend, or none. When you have multiple legends, guides can be used to reorder them, or even omit some altogether.

`theme_void() +`

Themes control the overall appearance of the plot. `theme_void` is an empty theme, giving us this floating map. 

`theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "bottom", legend.key.width = unit(2,"cm"), legend.text=element_text(size=12)) `

Our final line makes alterations to our chosen theme -- we've edited the typeface of the plot title and positioned it in the middle of the figure; moved the legend to the bottom and made it wider, and finally increased the font size of the legend ticks. These small touches make a big difference in the readability and visual appeal of our map.

<br>

### Publication-quality maps in R

With `ggplot2` we can go much further than simply recreating base R's plots. The layered nature of graphical grammar makes it easy to add additional features to our maps (points, annotations, etc). We can also exploit it to add base layers and logos, ultimately creating maps which rival any GIS software's output. 

<br>

#### Adding points to maps

Suppose we want to add the locations of health facilities in Fakeland to our map of API. `fakeland_hf_points` is an `sf` object, but this time consisting of points. That doesn't matter to `geom_sf`.

```{r, message = F}
fakeland_hf_gps <- read_csv("data/fakeland_hf_gps.csv")

# Make the gps data into a point simple feature
fakeland_hf_points <- st_as_sf(fakeland_hf_gps, coords = c("X", "Y"), crs = 4326)
# Assign some of these points to be hospitals
fakeland_hospitals <- sample(fakeland_hf_points$hf, 0.1*length(fakeland_hf_points$hf))

fakeland_hf_points <- fakeland_hf_points %>% 
  mutate(hf_type = if_else(hf %in% fakeland_hospitals, "Hospital", "Clinic"))

```


```{r, message = F}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = fakeland_annual, aes(fill = API), colour = "grey50", size = 0.2) + # now we need to tell ggplot an antribute of the data to use as an aesthetic
  scico::scale_fill_scico(palette = "nuuk", trans = "log", breaks = my_breaks) +
  geom_sf(data = fakeland_hf_points, aes(shape = hf_type), size = 2, colour = "grey20") + 
  labs(title = "API, Fakeland 20XX", fill = "API ",
       shape = "Health Facility") +
  coord_sf() + # deals with map projection
  guides() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "right", legend.key.width = unit(0.5,"cm"), 
        legend.key.height = unit(0.75,"cm"), legend.text=element_text(size=12)) 
```


Try moving the `geom_sf(data = fakeland_hf_points...)` call to above the `geom_sf(data = fakeland_annual...)` call: does the map still look how you wanted it to? 

To make the health-facility locations easier to see when superimposed on our map, we've switched away from viridis to a palette from the `scico` package. Like viridis, all 17 palettes from scico are perceptually uniform and colourblind safe.

<br>

#### Basemaps, compasses, and other finishing touches

For publications we often want to show some more contextual informaiton on our maps, rather than having Fakeland float in white-space. The grammar of graphics makes this easy -- we can add 'zoomed-out' geographic information as a "base" layer,  then layer our designed information on top.

Currently we only have a shapefile for Fakeland's health districts. Let's load in a regional Admin0 shapefile:

```{r, message = F}
admin0_regional <- st_read("shapefiles/regional/fakeland_admin0_region.shp")
```

If we make a quick plot of this, we can see this shapefile shows the countries surrounding Fakeland. To check out the names of these countries, let's try using a `geom_label` layer. To add the labels in the right positions, we'll need to tell R the x and y co-ordinates of the centroids -- luckily this is easy to do using `st_centroid`. Rememeber that `st_centroid` assumes planar projection, rather than lat-lons. We can safely ignore the warning here, as we're just plotting for explanatory purposes, but be careful!

```{r, message = F}
country_central_points<- st_centroid(admin0_regional)
country_central_points <- cbind(admin0_regional, st_coordinates(st_centroid(admin0_regional$geometry)))

ggplot(admin0_regional) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_text(data = country_central_points, aes(x = X, y = Y, label = cntry_n)) +
  theme_void()

```

So we can see that Fakeland is bordered by four countries -- Florin, Bartovia, Genovia and Maldonia --  with a coast to the south. We probably don't want to show this entire region in our base-map. We can reduce this to our desired buffer around Fakeland's bounding box using `coord_sf`. Alternatively, we could crop the entire regional shapefile to our desired spatial extent.

At the same time let's finish maping our base-map. We'll often want scale panels and directional arrows on our plots -- these are easy to implement by using the ``ggspatial`` package.

```{r, message = F}

if(!require(ggspatial)){
    install.packages("ggspatial")
    library(ggspatial)
}


ggplot(admin0_regional) +
  geom_sf(fill = "antiquewhite") +
  coord_sf(xlim= c(st_bbox(fakeland_annual)$xmin - .2, st_bbox(fakeland_annual)$xmax + .2),
           ylim = c(st_bbox(fakeland_annual)$ymin - 1, st_bbox(fakeland_annual)$ymax + 1)) +
  ggspatial::annotation_north_arrow(location = "bl", 
                                    which_north = "true",
                                    style = north_arrow_fancy_orienteering) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "aliceblue"), 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "aliceblue"),
        panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=5))

```

Finally, let's pull this all together. We may wish to plot out a number of metrics for Fakeland on this plot, so let's save this basemap as an R object we can call, without having to copy and paste all that code. Note that we need to call `coord_sf` after our final data layer.

```{r, message = F}

basemap <- ggplot(admin0_regional) +
  geom_sf(fill = "antiquewhite", colour = "grey80") +
  ggspatial::annotation_north_arrow(location = "bl", 
                                    which_north = "true",
                                    style = north_arrow_fancy_orienteering) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "aliceblue"), 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "aliceblue"),
        panel.border = element_rect(colour = "grey50", fill=NA, size=5))
```

### Demo 2

```{r, message=F}

basemap + 
  geom_sf(data = fakeland_annual, aes(fill = API), colour = "grey50", size = 0.2) + 
  scico::scale_fill_scico(palette = "nuuk", trans = "log", breaks = my_breaks) +
  labs(title = "API, Fakeland 20XX", fill = "API ",
       shape = "Health Facility") +
  coord_sf(xlim= c(st_bbox(fakeland_annual)$xmin - .2, st_bbox(fakeland_annual)$xmax + .2),
           ylim = c(st_bbox(fakeland_annual)$ymin - 1, st_bbox(fakeland_annual)$ymax + 1)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "right", legend.key.width = unit(0.5,"cm"), 
        legend.key.height = unit(0.75,"cm"), legend.text=element_text(size=12)) 
```

### Final thoughts

* 

<!-- ### Plotting shapefiles in R -->
<!-- So we've loaded spatial data in R, but what we would like to do here is make plots of them. Luckily, `sf` package connects nicely to `ggplot` so that can makes maps with the ggplot functions using `geom_sf()`. -->



<!-- ```{r fakeland map} -->
<!-- ggplot(annual_data_sf)+ -->
<!--   geom_sf()+ -->
<!--   theme_bw() -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We can even add multiple layers ontop of each other -->

<!-- ```{r fakland+hfs} -->
<!-- ggplot()+ -->
<!--   geom_sf(fakeland, mapping = aes(geometry = geometry))+  # we must include mapping() when loading data directly in geom_sf(), if we don't have any additional info we can simply load the geometry column -->
<!-- geom_sf(fakeland_hf_points, mapping = aes(geometry = geometry))+ -->
<!--   theme_bw() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- As we have joined our annual routine surveillance data to the shapefile we can also plot aspects of our data linked to the shapefile. (Creating maps in R will be covered further later in this session) -->

<!-- ```{r plot data} -->
<!-- ggplot(annual_data_sf)+ -->
<!--   geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = conf))+ -->
<!--   scale_fill_viridis_c() + # to use color blind friendly continuous color palette -->
<!--   labs( fill = "Confirmed cases")+ -->
<!--   theme_bw() -->
<!-- ``` -->
